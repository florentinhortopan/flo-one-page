```

## 🎯 Design Rationale

### Why Lightning for Punk?
- Represents raw energy
- Iconic punk rock symbol
- Aggressive, bold shape
- High visual impact
- Instantly recognizable

### Why Heart for Grunge?
- Emotional depth (emo culture)
- Romance and intimacy
- Gothic aesthetic
- Softer than lightning
- Elegant simplicity

### Why Not Sun/Moon?
- Too generic for dual themes
- Doesn't capture punk energy
- Doesn't convey grunge romance
- Every site uses sun/moon
- We wanted unique personality

## 🌟 Alternatives Considered

### For Punk:
- ⭐ Star: Too generic
- 💥 Sparkles: Not aggressive enough
- 🔥 Flame: Considered but cliché
- **⚡ Lightning: PERFECT** ✓

### For Grunge:
- 🌙 Moon: Too standard
- 🌹 Rose: Icon not available
- 🎭 Mask: Too theatrical
- **💖 Heart: PERFECT** ✓
